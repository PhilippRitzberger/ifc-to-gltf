### 2.1.0 2017-12-28

* Fixed loading faces that contain less than 3 vertices. [#120](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/120)
* Attempt to load missing materials and textures from within the same directory as the obj. [#117](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/117)
* Fixed loading mtllib paths that contain spaces. [#116](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/116)
* Fixed checking for transparency when the diffuse texture is used in another texture slot. [#115](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/115)
* Fixed parsing mtl textures that contain texture map options. [#109](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/109)
* Added back support for the `CONSTANT` technique when a model uses the `KHR_materials_common` extension and has no normals. [#108](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/108)
* Improved handling of materials with alpha. If the alpha value is 0.0 it is now treated as 1.0. [#107](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/107)

### 2.0.0 2017-08-11

* Breaking changes
    * Obj models now convert to glTF 2.0. Possible material profiles are `metallicRoughness`, `specGlossiness` (using the `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness` extension), and `materialsCommon` (using the `KHR_materials_common` extension).
    * Removed `gltf-pipeline` dependency. The following options have been removed: `compress`, `optimize`, `generateNormals`, `optimizeForCesium`, `ao`, and `bypassPipeline`.
    * Removed `inputUpAxis` and `outputUpAxis`. This stage will be incorporated into `gltf-pipeline` instead.
    * `obj2gltf` no longer takes a `gltfPath` argument and saves a glTF file. Instead it returns a promise that resolves to the glTF JSON or glb buffer.

### 1.3.0 2017-08-11

* Fixed parsing models with concave or n-sided faces. [#85](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/85)
* Fixed parsing models with line breaks. [#85](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/85)

### 1.2.0 2017-07-11

* Change texture sampling to use `NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR` by default. [#83](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/83).
* Fixed lighting when generating normals. [#89](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/89)

### 1.1.1 2017-04-25

* Fixed `CHANGES.md` formatting.

### 1.1.0 2017-04-25

* Added ability to convert the up-axis of the obj model. [#68](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/68)
* Fixed issues with an extra .bin file being saved when using `--separate`. [#62](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/62)
* Fixed issue where an ambient color of `[1, 1, 1]` overly brightens the converted model. [#70](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/70)

### 1.0.0 2017-04-13

* Breaking changes
    * To use `obj2gltf` as a library, call `require('obj2gltf')(input, output, options)`. The previous calling code was `require('obj2gltf').convert(input, output, options)`.
    * Many library options and command-line parameters have been renamed.
* Project cleanup. [#49](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf/pull/49)
    * Speed improvements, especially for larger models.
    * Preserves the objects and groups in the obj.
    * Added documentation and tests.
    * Material fixes.
